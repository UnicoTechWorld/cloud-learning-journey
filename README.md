# 🌩️Azure Cloud Journey (Corentin)

Welcome to my Azure cloud learning repository.
Here I document my full journey in the Microsoft Azure ecosystem — from foundational admin skills to advanced cloud architecture, networking, automation, and real-world projects.

This repository will contain:

🧩 Hands-on labs

🛠 Real-world scenarios

🌐 Network & infrastructure designs

🔐 Security & governance implementations

🧪 Troubleshooting exercises

🏗 Architecture diagrams

📘 Notes & documentation

🎓 Certification preparation (AZ-104, AZ-700, etc.)

My goal is to build a strong and practical Azure skillset while creating a clear portfolio that showcases my growth and experience.
